<h1 class="large">facebook 2</h1>
<p class="center">My name is Kim and I am the founder and CEO of facebook 2, here to announce the launch of facebook 2. I have a lot to learn about social media and copyright infringement, and have been helped by the gentleman that is sitting behing me.
	I cannot find an image of myself to upload.</p>

<h2 class="large">For the record:

	I do not give facebook 1 or any entities associated with facebook 1 permission to take legal action against my pictures, information, or businesses, both past and future.

	By this statement, I give notice to facebook 1 it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this website and/or its contents.

	The content of this website is listed under "fair-use" in US copyright law, all instances of legal action by facebook 1 or its subsidiaries is strictly forbidden by US law.

	The violation of the free market can be punished by law (UCC 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the Rome Statute).

	NOTE: facebook 1 is now a public entity. All CEOs (like me) must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing legal action against your website/business.</h2>
